        </div>

        <div class="inst" id="main-inst">
            <h2 class="inst">Overview:</h2>
            <p> Browser Sniper is the realistic
                marksmanship simulator designed for practicing mental math.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="inst" id="main-inst">
            <h2 class="inst">How to Play:</h2>
            <p> To officially become a Browser Sniper, you must hit at least 8 out of
                10 targets with the 15 rounds provided.

            <div class="inst" id="main-inst">

            </div>

            <p> Users can adjust the elevation (vertical plane) and windage (horizontal plane)
                of their shot with the "Action Buttons." The horizontal plane has a direction and
                a value (in mils) to it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="inst" id="main-inst">
            <p>
                Like any good sniper would have, you are provided a Range Card and a Wind Reference (at 500m) to assist
                in making the correct shot calls through the Action Buttons. You are also provided your DOPE (data on
                previous engagment) to assist in making shot adjustments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="inst" id="main-inst">
            <h2 class="inst">Gameplay:</h2>
            <p>
                When the game begins, users will be provided the target information through the TGT DIST (target
                distance),
                WND SPD (wind speed), and WND DIR (wind direction) displays. Using the reference cards and shooting
                position picture
                as a guide, users will input their inputs into the Action Buttons section for their shot and then press
                the FIRE button when ready.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="inst" id="main-inst">
            <h2 class="inst">Inputs</h2>
            <p>
                The user will only have to input three values before hitting the FIRE button: elevation, windage
                direction, and windage. <strong>It is very important to note
                    that elevation and windage (mils) take number inputs while the windage direction will only take
                    three values: "left", "right", or "center"
                </strong>
            </p>
        </div>
